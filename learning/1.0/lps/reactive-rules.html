A rule is said to have fired whenever conditions in its <code><i>antecedent</i></code> are met. When a rule is fired, LPS will attempt to find an instance of its consequent that holds by model generation and <a href="logic-program.html">logic programming</a>.</p><p>For example, to express a rule that says "if alice asked about weather, then reply my knowledge about the weather":</p><pre class="ml-3"><code>asked(alice, weather, T1, T2) -&gt; weather(Status, T2), reply(alice, Status, T2, T3).</code></pre><p>The predicate <code>asked/4</code> can be an observed event that, when observed, will fire the example rule. <code>weather/2</code> is a fluent for the fact <code>weather/1</code> that indicates the current agent's knowledge about the weather, and <code>reply/4</code> is an action that LPS can select for execution, which pressumbly would reply to alice about the weather.</p><p>When an instance of <code>asked(alice, weather)</code> is observed at some point in time, the temporal variables <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> will be instantiated and a new goal of</p><pre class="ml-3"><code>weather(Status, T2), reply(alice, Status, T2, T3)</code></pre><p>will be created in LPS for some value of <code>T2</code> substituted from the antecedent. LPS will then perform the 3-step goal resolution to try to find a empty goal cluase that represents the successful resolution of the given root goal of the fired rule.</p><p>Macro actions or composite actions can be defined by logic programming to enable antecedent pattern matching and description of alternative plans in the antecedent.</p><p>The use of definitions in logic programming can help LPS to recognise the occurance of complex events. At initialisation, LPS will perform a pre-processing step to expand composite actions by their definitions given in the logic program. An example program that demonstrates this pre-processing is given as follows:</p><pre class="ml-3"><code>bought(dinner, T1, T2) -&gt;
  eat(T2, T3).    % rule
bought(dinner, T1, T2) &lt;-
  bought(steak, T1, T2).
bought(dinner, T1, T2) &lt;-
  bought(burger, T1, T2),
  bought(fries, T1, T2)</code></pre><p>The rule pre-processing will generate two new rules from the existing rule, and the previous rule can be discarded:</p><pre class="ml-3"><code>bought(steak, T1, T2) -&gt;
  eat(T2, T3).    % new rule 1
bought(burger, T1, T2),
  bought(fries, T1, T2) -&gt;
    eat(T2, T3).    % new rule 2</code></pre><p>The fire simple and recurrent examples demonstrate how logic programming can describe alternative plans for the same goal, allowing a "OR" operation in the LPS semantics. The example of such a use case in the fire simple example is shown below:</p><pre class="ml-3"><code>fire(T1) -&gt; deal_with_fire(T1, T2).
deal_with_fire(T1, T2) &lt;- eliminate(T1, T2).
deal_with_fire(T1, T2) &lt;- escape(T1, T2).</code></pre></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.slim.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></body></html>
